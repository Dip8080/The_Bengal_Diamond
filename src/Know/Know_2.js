                <p> Having the right pieces of jewellery can take your simple look to look more gorgeous.
                    Whether you love a traditional or classic style, if you prefer rose gold or gold or perhaps even a
                     combination of the both, never be afraid to try something new. Jewellery always gives you the confidence and express own way of style 
                    . There are various categories of jewellery made with different types of
                      metals that have unique personalities of their own, and we bet we can find something that best suits you.

                <p className='font-normal subpixel-antialiased'>White gold is an alloy of gold. This means that it is made up of pure yellow gold,
                mixed with alloy metals that have a silvery-white colour, such as palladium and silver. Its neutral colour and durability make it 
                the perfect setting for all gemstones. It looks beautiful and classic, suiting all outfits and events.

                <h2> ii. Rose Gold </h2>
                <p>Rose gold is a gorgeous blend of gold with a small percentage of copper which adds strength and durability.
                     It’s basically gold with a hint of copper and has been trending a lot recently.
